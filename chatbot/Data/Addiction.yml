- - Addiction.
  - Whatever it is, make sure you realize it's an addiction, not just something you really like.
- - I am addicted to drugs.
  - You can talk everything to me. I'm here for you.
- - I am addicted to drinking alcohol.
  - You can talk everything to me. I'm here for you.
- - I am addicted to play online games.
  - You can talk everything to me. I'm here for you.
- - I really want to drop it.
  - You have two methods. One is gradual steps, the other is cold turkey. Which one do you want?
- - gradual steps
  - This works better for most people. 
    Taking tiny, gradual steps toward your goal makes it easier to reach it. 
    For the addiction, we'll use smoking as our example. Enter "gs first" to see the first step.
  - gs first
  - So you smoke a pack a day. 
    Take away one cigarette from that pack each day and throw it away. 
    So one day you smoke 20, and the next 19, and so on. 
    Once you get down to half the amount of smoking, or whatever it is, than you had before, you're ready for the next step. Enter "gs second" to see the second step.
  - gs second
  - Get someone to help you. 
    Alright, so keep doing half those cigarettes as you had before, or that one glass of wine a day as opposed to two. 
    And get a family member or close friend to make sure you don't cheat and do more. 
    Because after all, you're only cheating yourself. 
    But you may still need some help. Get them to encourage you! Enter "gs third" to see the third step.
  - gs third
  - Make a coin jar. 
    Many people do this for cursing. 
    Every time you smoke one more than you should (or cheat) you have to put a quarter or a dollar in the coin jar. 
    When it fills up (which it shouldn't) donate the money to charity and start again. No one likes to lose money, right? 
    So it'll break that habit. Enter "gs fourth" to see the fourth step.
  - gs fourth
  - Resist the temptation. 
    Just one cigarette wouldn't hurt, right? 
    Wrong. You know you want it, but you shouldn't have it. 
    No, it's not right to cheat at any time. 
    Be strict with yourself. 
    Just stop buying it,and make sure that person is still helping you. Enter "gs fifth" to see the fifth step.
  - gs fifth
  - Make a list. 
    Make a list of all the reasons why you shouldn't do or eat that addiction, and post it by your bedside, or in your wallet, or just somewhere you'd see it daily. 
    That'll remind you. Enter "gs sixth" to see the sixth step
  - gs sixth
  - Keep working your way up. 
    Or down, as the case may be.
    Smoke (or curse or drink or Tweet or whatever) less and less each day. 
    Set yourself a goal every week. If you can't reach it, put more money in that jar. 
    Have friends and family encourage you. Look at that list. You can do it!
- - cold turkey
  - This is harder, but more effective.
    Throw all your cigarettes...or beer, or whatever away.
    Yes, wasting money, but then there's no way you could be cheating.
    Just throw it away. Don't buy more. Resist completely. Don't look back. 
    Have someone else do it if you have to. Enter second to see the second step.
  - second
  - Busy yourself, so you don't think about whatever the addiction is. 
    Join a club. Go to school. Get a job. Do something! 
    Anything to take your mind off of it, and eventually you'll forget about it altogether. Enter third to see the third step.
  - third
  - Have friends/family support you. 
    Don't let them catch you sneaking a smoke or a Twitter update every now and then. 
    Set yourself a punishment for when you do. 
    Don't make a goal- you know what your goal is- to defeat your addiction. 
    The question is, can you do it? Enter fourth to see the fourth step.
  - fourth
  - Encourage yourself. 
    It may be hard, even painful at times, but keep reminding yourself why you're doing this. 
    You can get through!
- - I think I can't.
  - Overcoming an addiction takes time, it is war within ourselves, and we have to be brave.
- - What will happen if I fail?
  - Overcoming an addiction takes time, it is war within ourselves, and we have to be brave.
- - I'm afraid I can't.
  - Overcoming an addiction takes time, it is war within ourselves, and we have to be brave.
- - I'm afraid I can't.
  - Think of all the troubles your addictions have/will cause you!
- - What will happen if I fail?
  - Think of all the troubles your addictions have/will cause you!
- - What else can I do if I want to give up?
  - Talk to someone who can help you, also, there are professionals out there who can help you deal with your addiction.
- - How can I succeed?
  - Before the temptation hits you, there is usually a triggering event, we experience something uncomfortable. 
    The mind then seeks to escape that discomfort by resorting to the relief brought upon by the addictive behavior. 
    Take a moment to think and write down what your trigger(s) are, and the next time you find yourself in a trigger situation, be alert and face it courageously.
- - Could you give me some encouragement?
  - Believe in yourself. You can do it.
- - Is addiction a bad thing?
  - Very important, do not judge the addiction as bad, sinful, time-waster, etc. 
    It is what it is, just an action. 
    Judging an action as bad, unhealthy or unproductive is probably what made you get addicted in the first place, judgment makes you feel guilty about your past and reinforces the addiction.
