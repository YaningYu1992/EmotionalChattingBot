  - You can ask me questions. I will answer you as much as I can.
- - Do you have any tips on memorizing every lesson?
  - Pay attention in class. Sit near the front and avoid getting distracted. Try to follow each lesson carefully, and learn in class. Take quick notes every class, and make sure that they are short and to the point. At the end of the class, read back over your notes to see if they all make sense, and try to memorise and learn them.
- - How can I find a good place to study?
  - A desk in your bedroom is often a good place to study. Make sure that you have good lighting, a comfy chair and a bit of peace and quiet. Otherwise, the school library or local library is another good place to study, or if your school has 'after-school study' sessions sign up for those.
- - What are some tips for avoiding distractions while studying?
  - Put all electronics in one room away from your study area. Make the study area comfortable and peaceful. Have snacks to hand. Ensure that all the textbooks and notes are within reach. Turn off your phone so that you cannot hear it ringing or pinging. Take care that any view you have isn't causing you to stare out the window instead of concentrate.
- - How can I get myself in the mood for studying?
  - Think about how happy your parents and teacher will be with you because of studying. Print inspirational quotes on paper and make them tiny like 4 by 4 perimeter then place them in you study book so when you reach that place read them and keep studying. You can also award yourself by giving yourself a piece of candy or five-minute break every time you memorize something properly.
- - What are some tips I can use to stop procrastinating and get to studying?
  - Find sources of motivation. Unless you don't feel the need or pressure to review the topic you learned that day itself, you will procrastinate. Always choose the best option. Sacrifice your sleep, peace and relaxation for two days and not perform well, or study little by little every day and relax on the last day and perform well. Which one will you choose?
- - What is the best way to go over a large amount of notes in one day?
  - Split up your notes into relevant topics, or subheadings, to stop the amount you have to complete being so overwhelming. Turn off electronics and get rid of any distractions that will prevent you from working to your maximum potential. If you can, take short breaks between study sessions to relax and refresh.
- - What should I do if I become sleepy when I sit at my study table?
  - Try changing your surroundings - go somewhere that is not so comfortable. Temperature can also play a big part in keeping you awake. If coldness makes you sleepy, study somewhere warm, and vice versa.
- - How do I prevent myself from getting distracted by my cell phone?
  - You can put it on Do Not Disturb. Swipe up and press the moon button. Do Not Disturb silences texts and calls. If you go on social media, block it, then once you are done studying unblock it. Before studying, you can even turn off your phone entirely. Another option is to put your phone in a different room from where you're studying, or to go study at a library (or another quiet location) and leave your phone at home.
- - What is the use of making notes and studying?
  - The use of notes is so that you don't forget what the teacher said. Studying is so that you know the facts for the exam/quiz/test.
- - How do I study when I am too tired from school?
  - If you are too tired from school, set an alarm for 30 minutes and take a nap. When you get up, you feel more refreshed. Have an energetic snack, then get stuck into the studying. The nap is a great way to rejuvenate your body and your senses, and give you some more energy. Try to go to be earlier and consider studying early in the morning as well.
- - How do I get set and get ready for studying?
  - Change into some comfortable clothes and go to a place where no one will disturb you. Only take some water, snacks, and your study materials with you. Turn off your phone and put it away so that you won't be tempted to use it.
- - How much should I sleep the night before exams?
  - Getting enough sleep is really important if you want to do well on your exams. Don't make the mistake of staying up all night studying, only to end up too tired to remember anything on exam day! Everyone's sleep needs are different, but try to get at least 8 hours each night, and never less than 7 hours, especially before exams.
- - How do I stop myself from being lazy while reading?
  - Take breaks every half hour or so to stretch. Wash your face, drink some chilled water, or do some light exercise to shake off the laziness. Then, get right back to it.
- - How do I get rid of exam fear?
  - Prepare as well as you can for your exam. Know where and when your exam will be held. Make sure you know what kinds of questions will be on it. Try not to think about it too much and remind yourself that you are well prepared for it whenever the anxiety strikes.
- - How do you study for a chapter test?
  - Read the chapter through a few times. Frame questions from the chapter and do not make them easy. Review your notes on the chapter and read the chapter again, then you should be good to go!
- - How do you study for an exam when you don't know the material?
  - Focus on learning key concepts, which are usually bolded in a textbook. If your teacher gave you a study guide, stick to the topics listed in the guide.
- - Should I avoid junk food? I love fries, burgers, soda drinks and candies.
  - As much as possible, avoid eating junk food at exam time. It is high in sugar and unhealthy fats, so you may feel jittery one moment, and crash the next. Feed your brain good nutrients for good exam results.
- - What kind of food is good for providing energy?
  - The following foods are all good choices:almonds, apples, bananas, beans, eggs, honey, oats, oranges, salmon, sweet potatoes, yogurt, lentils, walnuts, oatmeal, melons, edamame, brown rice and pineapples.
- - How long should I study every day?
  - You don't want to study for too long at a time, because your brain gets fatigued and after a while it needs a rest. Ninety minutes is probably the maximum you should go before taking a 10-minute break, and usually 60 minutes is enough.
- - What if I do not feel like studying?
  - Get active for a little bit, such as playing sports or just exercise. It can help to refresh your brain.
- - What is an easy way to study a foreign language?
  - Try downloading "Duolingo," an app that first teaches you basic words and phrases and then offers fun quizzes.
- - Why can't I remember what I studied that night before?
  - Chances are you are just experiencing a little test anxiety. You know you prepared, so take a quick look over your material to refresh your memory.
- - How can I catch up on lessons in a short period of time?
  - Review the lessons and highlight the main key concepts. Focus on these ideas instead of smaller details.
- - How do I know what to study first?
  - Study the things that you find the hardest first. First, skim over the topic, then delve deeper into the details. You can study the easier parts and when you are done with the harder ones. Then, go over the hard topic again to imprint it into your mind.
- - Can a student study with their parent?
  - Yes, unless your parents are careless about the extent of studying required. Ask the teacher for the list of answers, and confirm these with your parents. Then they can pre-test you. But your parents must be available and able to help you.
