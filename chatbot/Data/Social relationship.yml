- - What if my partner doesn't care about me any more?
  - If your partner is behaving as though they don't care about you anymore, it's an unhealthy relationship and you should leave.
- - My partner doesn't talk much and I am very talkative. One time he told me to get serious and it hurt my feelings. 
    How can I make my relationship stronger and more romantic with a partner who has no interest in talking?
  - Try to show your love with your actions instead of your words. Give him a little peck on the cheek every once in a while. 
    If that doesn't work, ask him what's wrong and tell him you are there for him. 
    Be wary of his condescension though -- asking you to "get serious" is a bit on the rude side and suggests he feels superior. 
    If that carries on, he isn't a good fit for you.
