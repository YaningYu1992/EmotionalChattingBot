  - In the United States, nearly 30 million people of all ages and genders are afflicted with eating disorders. 
    Among those who suffer, a large majority are female. 
    If you or someone you know exhibits the signs of an eating disorder, it's important to take action immediately. 
    These conditions have the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders, so getting help for yourself or your loved one could save a life.

  - Pay attention to the physical warning signs. 
    You must be honest with yourself when you spot the warning signs of an eating disorder.
    Having such a condition can be life-threatening. 
    Don't underestimate the seriousness of your eating disorder, and don't overestimate your ability to treat yourself.

  - Talk to a therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders. 
    A trained professional can help you work through the thoughts and feelings that are compelling you to diet excessively or binge-eat. 
    If you feel too ashamed to talk to anyone, be reassured that a therapist trained in eating disorders will not make you feel ashamed of yourself. 
    These therapists have devoted their professional lives to helping others overcome eating disorders. 
    They know what you're going through, they understand the underlying causes and, more importantly, they can help you work through them.

  - Determine why you may have developed disordered eating habits. 
    You can help the therapy by doing some self-exploration into why you feel compelled to keep losing weight and to despise your body. 
    There may be some self-revelations that help you to personally better understand how your eating habits have morphed into an unhealthy way of coping with something else that harms you, 
    such as family conflict, lack of love or never feeling good enough.

  - Keep a food journal. 
    A food journal has two purposes. 
    The first, more practical purpose, is to establish your eating patterns and to allow you and your therapist to work out what types of food you're eating, when and how. 
    The second, more subjective part of a food journal, is to write down your thoughts, feelings and emotions associated with the food habits you've cultivated. 
    And, ultimately, it's a place to write down your fears (so that you can face them) and your dreams (so that you can start planning goals and working toward them).
    Enter "ed fifth" to see the fifth step.

  - Seek support from a trusted friend or family member. 
    Talk to this person about what you're going through. 
    It will often be the case that he or she will be worried about you 
    and will be very willing to try to help you work through the eating disorder, 
    even if it's just about being there for you.

  - Find other ways to cope with your emotions. 
    Find positive outlets in which to relax or unwind after a stressful day. 
    Allow yourself these personal moments of down time, focused just on you. 
    For example, listen to music, take a hike, watch the sunset, or write in a journal. 
    The possibilities are endless – find something you enjoy doing that relaxes you to help you deal with harmful and stressful emotions.

  - Adopt healthy coping mechanisms to counteract stress. 
    Ground yourself when you feel out of control. 
    Call someone on the phone and focus on the person's voice, touch things close to you, such as a desk, counter, fluffy toy or wall, or hug someone you feel safe with. 
    Grounding techniques allow you to reconnect with reality and refrain from dwelling in either the past or present.

  - Be as kind to yourself as you are to other people. 
    Look at people around you that you find beautiful with all their quirks. 
    Appreciate yourself in the same ways. 
    Look at the beauty inside you instead of focusing on the flaws. 
    Stop being so harsh on your looks – every configuration of the human body is a miracle, a moment of life breathed into the continuum of time, and you deserve to be happy and here right now.

  - Put away the scale. Nobody should weigh themselves daily, eating disorder or not. 
    To do so is to map an unrealistic fluctuation of personal weight and to set oneself up for an obsession with numbers instead of focusing on the greater whole. 
    Gradually reduce the frequency of self-weighing until you're only weighing yourself once or twice a month.

  - Take baby steps. 
    Notice every little change to a healthier self as a big step in the healing process. 
    Increase your food portions gradually, exercise slightly less frequently, etc. 
    Trying to stop abruptly will not only be harder on yourself emotionally, but can shock your body and cause other health problems. 
    Again, this aspect is best done under the supervision of a professional, such as your eating disorder specialist.
