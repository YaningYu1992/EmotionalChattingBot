- - anxiety
  - You can ask me questions. I will answer you as much as I can.
- - I am always stressed out and judge people who come in contact with me. How can I stop?
  - Just keep very calm and count to ten with your eyes shut and then greet the person when they come over. After all, if everyone on the earth was mean and horrible, then nobody would have friends. So just give them a chance and judge them when you know them properly... Also take a lavender bath to help you sleep and avoid stress. Ultimately, learn to better manage your stress so that you control it, not letting it control you. Give yourself time off the things that push you, after all, you cannot gain perspective when stuck in the bottom of a dark chasm.
- - How do I overcome anxiety without smoking weed?
  - If none of the steps in this article help, try seeing a therapist or counselor (free therapy may be available through community groups, your education provider if applicable, or local colleges if you don't mind talking to trainees). Avoiding weed is a very good decision - even in jurisdictions where it's legal, many people find it actually makes their anxiety worse.
- - Does sugar facilitate anxiety?
  - Yes, because sugar increases your adrenaline levels which makes your emotions hype up. Some people think that it makes them relax, but in truth it only makes you more anxious because you will probably regret eating the sugars and that makes you more depressed.

- - I need to know how to get over my parents' separation after 48 years. I have anxiety so bad that I can't leave my house or drive a car. What can I do?
  - This is their relationship and their decision, it's not something you have control over. First up, if your anxiety is as bad as you say, seek therapy -- even have a therapist come to your house. Second, are your parents expecting you to ease their own trauma? If so, ask them to not do that to you and to get their own therapy and help for their own decision. They do not have a right to expect you to fill the gaps they've created in their lives.

You are safe, no one will die, etc.

- - Does your subconscious mind know more then your conscious mind?
  - What your subconscious and conscious minds "know" are different things. The difficulty is being aware of the the knowledge within your subconscious, or knowing how to tap into that and trust it as a form of intuition or gut instinct.

Just remember as long as you're nice and don't wear the same clothes everyday, people will like you.
